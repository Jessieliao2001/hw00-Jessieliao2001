## My Intro
*Hi everybody!*
![My Picture](selfie.png)
I'm **Jiaying Liao** from the **MACSS** program and in the **econ track**. Most of my friends just call me ***Jessie***. 

### Facts about me
* About my UG: I went to University of Macau for my undergrad, with a major in economics and a minor in applied math. In UMac I also learned a little French and Spanish ;) exciting if we can have a chat!

* About my hobbies: Interested in *indoor activities* and if you're finding someone for **karaoke**, just call me!

## Summary & Reflection
1. To add Headers, we can use "# Title"
2. To add Emphasis, we can use "**Importance**"
3. To begin lists, we can use "1." or "* "
What I learned new is how to add Images and Links in the README.md file.
4. To add Images, we can use "![Name for image](filenameofphoto.jpg)"
5. To add Links, we can use "[Websitename](URL)"
Those two new ways of insertion make README.md file more interactive and informative. Also provided me a new way of notetaking!
