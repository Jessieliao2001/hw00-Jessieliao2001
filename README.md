# hw01

Edit this README file to include a brief biography of yourself. Your README should include the following elements:
* Headers (one or more)
* Emphasis (italics or/and bold)
* Lists
* Images: add a picture (of yourself or something else) to your repo and embed it in your README
* Links
* A summary and reflection of the Git/GitHub workflow you adopted for this homework, and of your experience with Markdown (e.g., provide a summary of the workflow you adopted, and add some comments about something new you learned, something that surprised you, etc.)

# My Intro
*Hi everybody!*
![My Picture](selfie.png)
I'm **Jiaying Liao** from the **MACSS** program and in the **econ track**. Most of my friends just call me ***Jessie***. 

## Facts about me
* About my UG: I went to University of Macau for my undergrad, with a major in economics and a minor in applied math. In UMac I also learned a little French and Spanish ;) exciting if we can have a chat! 
[My page in UMacau](https://econ.fss.um.edu.mo/bachelor-student-placement)
* About my hobbies: Interested in *indoor activities* and if you're finding someone for **karaoke**, just call me!

# Summary & Reflection
1. To add Headers, we can use "# Title"
2. To add Emphasis, we can use "**Importance**"
3. To begin lists, we can use "1." or "* "
What I learned new is how to add Images and Links in the README.md file.
4. To add Images, we can use "![Name for image](filenameofphoto.jpg)"
5. To add Links, we can use "[Websitename](URL)"
Those two new ways of insertion make README.md file more interactive and informative. Also provided me a new way of notetaking!
